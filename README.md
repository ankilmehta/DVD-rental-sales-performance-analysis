What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. Object-relational databases use a hybrid approach to databases.

    In object databases, information is stored as objects, much like object-oriented programming.

    In relational databases, information is stored in tables with relationships between tables defined by primary and foreign keys. 

Importantly, PostgreSQL allows the use of advanced functions (such as Window Functions), and even development and use of custom functions written in different programming languages. Here is a link to better understand what is meant by an object-relational database, and how it differs from a relational database.
